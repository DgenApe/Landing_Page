# Landing_Page
This is the final assignment of the CSS portion of the odin project before begining JavaScript
This project gives you a png file for how the sample website is supposed to look.
My job is to recreate the webpage from a blank CSS and HTML file
I feel as though I am a 9/10 prepared for this.
I have taken copious notes on the entirety of TOP and have practiced nonstop.
I am excited to put my skills to the test by recreating this landing page
